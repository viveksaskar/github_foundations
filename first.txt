Hell test - github!
What are gists
Now that we have a good understanding of repositories, we can review gists. Similarly to repositories, gists are a simplified way to share code snippets with others.

Every gist is a Git repository, which you can fork and clone and can be either public or secret.

Public gists are displayed publicly where people can browse new ones as they’re created. Public gists are also searchable.

Conversely, secret gists are not searchable, but they aren’t entirely private. If you send the URL of a secret gist to a friend, they'll be able to see it.

To learn more about gists see the linked article in our Resources section at the end of this module titled, Creating Gists.

What are wikis?
Every repository on GitHub.com comes equipped with a section for hosting documentation, called a wiki.

You can use your repository's wiki to share long-form content about your project, such as how to use it, how you designed it, or its core principles.

While a README file quickly tells what your project can do, you can use a wiki to provide additional documentation.

It’s worth a reminder that if your repository is private only people who have at least read access to your repository will have access to your wiki.
